# Codewars
Train katas on Codewars.

I will publish some of the code, but mostly the git is for me to store, what Katas I have done so far.

I will use the Wiki pages to manage the amount of katas I solved. I think most Katas below 6 aren't that difficult, so I wonÂ´t showcase the code.

I try to solve 7 Katas a per week.

Number of Katas solved: 182
